### Usage
The code is plcaed inside `code` folder. Use `main.py` to run the script.
```
usage: main.py [-h] [-d DATA] [--type TYPE] [-s S] method
Android Malware Classificator

positional arguments:  method       mnb=MultinomialNB, bnb=BernoulliNB, sgdc=SGDClassifier, 
                                    lsvc=LinearSVC, svm=SVM, rf=RandomForest

optional arguments:
  -h, --help   show this help message and exit
  -d DATA      path to the dataset folder
  --type TYPE
  -s S         Feature subset
  ```
  
The dataset is palced inside `data` folder. There are two subfolders, `small_drebin`, which contains a very little portion of the original dataset, and `medium_drebin`, which contains roughly 5500 files. By default the script uses the medium folder. To use custom data, put it inside `data` folder. It should have this format:

```
- data
  |__ custom_data
      |__ feature_vectors
          |__ file_1
          |__ file_2
          ...
          |__ file_n
      |__ sha256_family.csv  
```
